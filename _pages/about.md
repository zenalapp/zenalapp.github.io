**Current**

I'm a Director's Postdoctoral Fellow studying HIV transmission with [Thomas Leitner](https://public.lanl.gov/tkl/) and [Ethan Romero-Severson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OaMKtrEAAAAJ&hl=en) at Los Alamos National Lab. 

When I’m not working, I enjoy backpacking, climbing, running in the park, playing soccer and tennis, and generally being outdoors!

**Past**

I graduated with a dual degree in Bioinformatics (PhD) and Statistics (MA) at the University of Michigan where I studied infectious disease transmission, infection, and antibiotic resistance evolution in [Evan Snitkin’s lab](https://thesnitkinlab.com/). I next did a two-year postdoc at the Duke Global Health Institute studying malaria parasite transmission between humans and mosquitos with [Steve Taylor](https://sites.duke.edu/taylorlab/) and [Wendy Prudhomme-O'Meara](https://sites.duke.edu/wpomeara/).

<!-- I'm interested in applying my data science skills to pressing global issues including health, poverty, and sustainable development. -->

At Michigan, I co-founded a [Girls Who Code](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/) club that teaches high school women computational data analysis using Python, instructed [Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/) workshops, helped coordinate the [Data Analysis Networking Group (DANG)](https://um-dang.github.io/), and lead various coding activities for grade school children. 
While at Duke, I co-led two [DiscovR workshops](https://duke-malaria-collaboratory.github.io/DiscovR/) to teach data managers in Kenya foundational data analysis and visualization skills in R.
