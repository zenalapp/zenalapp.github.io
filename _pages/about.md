I’m pursuing a PhD in Bioinformatics in [Evan Snitkin’s lab](https://thesnitkinlab.com/) at the University of Michigan. I graduated with a BA in biochemistry and molecular biology from the College of Wooster. I use a combination of R and Python to study infectious disease transmission, infection, and antibiotic resistance evolution. I'm involved with [Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/) and a local chapter of [Girls Who Code](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/) where we teach high school girls computational data analysis using Python. I am also a coordinator of the [Data Analysis Networking Group (DANG)](https://um-dang.github.io/) here at the University of Michigan.

When I’m not in lab, I love to be outdoors. You’ll most likely find me swimming in the pool, riding my bike, or running in the park!
