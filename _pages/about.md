I am pursuing a dual degree in Bioinformatics (PhD) and Statistics (MS) at the University of Michigan studying infectious disease transmission, infection, and evolution of antibiotic resistance in [Evan Snitkin’s lab](https://thesnitkinlab.com/) using R and Python. 

I'mm interested in applying my data science skills to pressing global issues including health, poverty, and sustainable development.

I co-founded a [Girls Who Code](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/) club at the University of Michigan where we teach high school girls computational data analysis using Python, instruct [Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/) workshops, was a coordinator of the [Data Analysis Networking Group (DANG)](https://um-dang.github.io/), and lead various coding activities for grade school children.

When I’m not working, I enjoy climbing, running in the park, and generally being outdoors!
