I am pursuing a dual degree in Bioinformatics (PhD) and Statistics (MS) at the University of Michigan studying infectious disease transmission, infection, and antibiotic resistance evolution in [Evan Snitkin’s lab](https://thesnitkinlab.com/). 

<!-- I'm interested in applying my data science skills to pressing global issues including health, poverty, and sustainable development. -->

I co-founded a [Girls Who Code](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/) club at the University of Michigan where we teach high school women computational data analysis using Python, instruct [Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/) workshops, helped coordinate the [Data Analysis Networking Group (DANG)](https://um-dang.github.io/), and lead various coding activities for grade school children.

When I’m not working, I enjoy running in the park, climbing, and generally being outdoors!
